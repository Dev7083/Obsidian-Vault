#### What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.
##### Algorithm : Add two numbers entered by the user
```
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables num1, num2 and sum. 
Step 3: Read values num1 and num2. 
Step 4: Add num1 and num2 and assign the result to sum.
        sum←num1+num2 
Step 5: Display sum 
Step 6: Stop
```

#### Data Structure:-

- Used to store and organize data.
- It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

Note: Data structure and data types are slightly different. Data structure is the collection of data types arranged in a specific order.

#### Types :-

1. Linear : elements are arranged in sequence one after the other
2. Non-linear : arranged in a hierarchical manner where one element will be connected to one or more elements. Further divided into tree based & graph based.

| The data items are arranged in sequential order, one after the other.                                                                             | The data items are arranged in non-sequential order (hierarchical manner).                                                                     |
| All the items are present on the single layer.                                                                                                    | The data items are present at different layers.                                                                                                |
| It can be traversed on a single run. That is, if we start from the first element, we can traverse all the elements sequentially in a single pass. | It requires multiple runs. That is, if we start from the first element it might not be possible to traverse all the elements in a single pass. |
| The memory utilization is not efficient.                                                                                                          | Different structures utilize memory in different efficient ways depending on the need.                                                         |
| The time complexity increase with the data size.                                                                                                  | Time complexity remains the same.                                                                                                              |
| Example: Arrays, Stack, Queue                                                                                                                     | Example: Tree, Graph, Map                                                                                                                      |

**Programming is all about data structures and algorithms. Data structures are used to hold data while algorithms are used to solve the problem using that data.**
